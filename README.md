## Generative AI Labs

This repository contains three comprehensive labs designed to explore and enhance dialogue summarization using generative AI models:

1. **Summarize Dialogue with Generative AI**: Dive into the practical aspects of dialogue summarization by experimenting with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences. Learn the basics of prompt engineering to guide the model towards accurate summarization tasks.

2. **Fine-Tune a Generative AI Model for Dialogue Summarization**: Utilize the FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face, known for its high-quality instruction tuning. Fine-tune the model to improve dialogue summarization and evaluate the performance using ROUGE metrics. Explore the benefits of Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to achieve enhanced results with optimized resource usage.

3. **Fine-Tune FLAN-T5 with Reinforcement Learning (PPO) and PEFT for Less-Toxic Summaries**: Implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model for generating less-toxic content. Utilize Meta AI's hate speech reward model to reduce the model's toxicity while maintaining performance.

Each lab provides a hands-on approach to mastering generative AI techniques and enhancing the capabilities of large language models.
