# Generative_AI-and-Large-Language-Model
 This repository contains three labs focused on enhancing dialogue summarization with generative AI, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning the FLAN-T5 model, and reducing toxicity using reinforcement learning. Each lab provides practical insights into optimizing large language models for better performance.
